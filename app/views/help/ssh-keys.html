    <h2 translate>How to generate RSA keys</h2>
    <h3>Ubuntu</h3>
    <p>
      <span translate>On your machine create public and private SSH keys using the command-line:</span>
        <br/>
        <i>mkdir ~/.ssh</i>
        <br/>
        <i>chmod 700 ~/.ssh</i>
        <br/>
        <i>ssh-keygen -t rsa</i>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span translate>You will be asked to confirm keys location and create passphrase to protect your private key:</span>
    <pre class="code"> Generating public/private rsa key pair.
 Enter file in which to save the key (/home/b/.ssh/id_rsa):
 Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
 Enter same passphrase again:
 Your identification has been saved in /home/b/.ssh/id_rsa.
 Your public key has been saved in /home/b/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span translate>After successful creation you should copy id_rsa.pub (your public key)
          content and paste it into "Public key" input on Add key page</span><br/>
      <span translate>For other Linux systems search instructions for your distribution.</span>
    </p>
    <h3>OS X</h3>
    <p>
      <span translate>Instructions are pretty much the same as for Linux,</span><br/>
      <span translate>but you may omit directory creation and enter only this line</span>
        <pre class="code"> ssh-keygen -t rsa</pre>
    </p>
    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p>
      <span translate>On of the possible ways to create SSH keys on Windows is using</span> <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">Git Bash</a>.
      <span translate>This set of steps is based this tool, you need to install it to proceed further.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span translate>At first check if you already have public key, if so you can use it on our Add Key page.</span>
      <span translate>Open Git Bash and enter:</span>
        <pre class="code"> ls -al ~/.ssh</pre>
        <span translate>This command will show existing files in your .ssh directory. Public key has .pub extension
          (usually id_rsa.pub)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span translate>To generate new SSH key pair in your Git Bash enter:</span>
        <pre class="code"> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"</pre>
        <span translate>This will create new ssh key, using the provided email as a label, when you see information about
          choosing keys directory just press Enter.</span> <br/>
        <span translate>You will also be asked to enter a passphrase.
          After all is done you will see output like this:</span>
        <pre class="code">
 # Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
 # Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
 # The key fingerprint is:
 # 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@example.com</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span translate>Next, you have to enable your ssh-agent and add keys that you have created.</span> <br/>
      <span translate>Open your Git Bash and start the agent:</span>
        <pre class="code">
 # start the ssh-agent in the background
 ssh-agent - s</pre>
      <span translate>Add your SSH key to ssh-agent:</span>
        <pre class="code">
 ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa</pre>
      <span translate>That's it, you are ready to go!</span>
