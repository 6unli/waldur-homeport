        <h2>1. Your Agreement with OpenNode</h2>
        <p><strong>1.1</strong> Your use of the NodeConductor service is governed by this agreement (the “Terms”). “OpenNode” means
            OpenNode, L.L.C., located at Lille 4-205, Pärnu 80041, Estonia, and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved
            in providing the NodeConductor Service. The “NodeConductor Services” means the services OpenNode makes available
            through this website, including this website, the NodeConductor cloud computing service, the NodeConductor API,
            the NodeConductor Plugins, the NodeConductor Components, and any other software or services offered by OpenNode
            in connection to any of those.</p>
        <p><strong>1.2</strong> In order to use the NodeConductor Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms
            by actually using the NodeConductor Services. You understand and agree that OpenNode will treat your use of
            the NodeConductor Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</p>

        <p><strong>1.3</strong> You may not use the NodeConductor Services if you are a person barred from receiving the NodeConductor
            Services under the laws of the Estonia or other countries, including the country in which you are resident
            or from which you use the NodeConductor Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the NodeConductor
            Services are not intended for children under 13.</p>

        <p><strong>1.4</strong> You agree your purchases of NodeConductor Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future
            functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by OpenNode or any of
            its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.</p>

        <h2>2. Your Account and Use of the NodeConductor Services</h2>
        <p><strong>2.1</strong> You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register
            to use the NodeConductor Services. You are responsible for the security of your passwords and for any use
            of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree
            to notify OpenNode immediately.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2</strong> Your use of the NodeConductor Services must comply with all applicable laws, regulations
            and ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software.</p>
        <p><strong>2.3</strong> You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of
            the NodeConductor Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by OpenNode in
            connection with the NodeConductor Services, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate
            agreement with OpenNode, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the NodeConductor
            Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).</p>
        <p><strong>2.4</strong> You may use the NodeConductor Services only to develop and run applications on
            the OpenNode infrastructure. You may not access the NodeConductor Services for the purpose of bringing
            an intellectual property infringement claim against OpenNode or for the purpose of creating a product
            or service competitive with the NodeConductor Services.</p>

        <h2>3. Service Policies and Privacy</h2>
        <p><strong>3.1</strong> You agree to comply with the OpenNode Acceptable Use Policy (the “Acceptable Use Policy”)
            which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated from time to time.</p>
        <p><strong>3.2</strong> The NodeConductor Services shall be subject to the privacy policy for the NodeConductor
            Services available at privacy policy. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with OpenNode’s
            privacy policies.</p>
        <p><strong>3.3</strong> You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal rights of the End Users
            of your application. You must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for End Users.
            If End Users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information,
            you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application and to OpenNode.</p>

        <h2>4. Fees for Use of the NodeConductor Services</h2>
        <p><strong>4.1</strong> Subject to the Terms, the NodeConductor Services is provided to you without charge up to
            certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services.
            The pricing for additional resources and services can be found at http://nodeconductor.com/pricing
            (or such URL as OpenNode may provide).</p>
        <p><strong>4.2</strong> For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card on a monthly
            basis or at the interval indicated in OpenNode fees and payment policies, if different. Late payments may
            bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are
            exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable
            expenses and attorneys fees OpenNode incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
            you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect
            your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on OpenNode’s measurements of your use of
            the NodeConductor Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
            refunds (if any) are at the discretion of OpenNode and only in the form of credit for the NodeConductor
            Services. Nothing in these Terms obligates OpenNode to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree
            that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to OpenNode may be shared
            by OpenNode with companies who work on OpenNode’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies,
            solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to OpenNode and servicing your account.
            OpenNode may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants
            and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. OpenNode shall
            not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. OpenNode reserves the right
            to discontinue the provision of the NodeConductor Services to you for any late payments.</p>
        <p><strong>4.3</strong> OpenNode may change its fees and payment policies for the NodeConductor Services by notifying you
            at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect.
            Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the website (or such other URL OpenNode may provide
            from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms
            for any reason.</p>
        <p><strong>4.4</strong> You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access
            the NodeConductor Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.</p>
        <h2>5. Content on the NodeConductor Services and Take Down Obligations</h2>
        <p><strong>5.1</strong> You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio
            files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) to which you may have access as part of, or through
            your use of, the NodeConductor Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content
            originated. All such information is referred to below as the “Content.” The term Content shall specifically
            exclude the web application that you create using the NodeConductor Services and any source code written
            by you to be used with the NodeConductor Services (collectively, “Applications”).</p>
        <p><strong>5.2</strong> OpenNode reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to remove any or all Content from
            the NodeConductor Services. You agree to immediately take down any Content that violates the Acceptable
            Use Policy, including pursuant to a take down request from OpenNode. In the event that you elect not to
            comply with a request from OpenNode to take down certain Content, OpenNode reserves the right to directly
            take down such Content or to disable Applications.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3</strong> In the event that you become aware of any violation of the Acceptable Use Policy by an End User
            of Applications, you shall immediately terminate such end user’s account on your Application. OpenNode
            reserves the right to disable Applications in response to a violation or suspected violation of
            the Acceptable Use Policy.</p>
        <p><strong>5.4</strong> You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that OpenNode has no responsibility to you or to
            any third party for) the Application or any Content that you create, transmit or display while using
            the NodeConductor Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which
            OpenNode may suffer) by doing so.</p>
        <p><strong>5.5</strong> You agree that OpenNode has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any
            Content and other communications maintained or transmitted through use of the Service. You further acknowledge
            that you are solely responsible for securing and backing up your Applications and any Content.</p>
        <h2>6. Proprietary Rights</h2>
        <p><strong>6.1</strong> You acknowledge and agree that OpenNode (or OpenNode’s licensors) own all legal right,
            title and interest in and to the NodeConductor Services, including any intellectual property rights which
            subsist in the NodeConductor Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in
            the world those rights may exist).</p>
        <p><strong>6.2</strong> Except as provided in Section 8, OpenNode acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no
            right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content or Applications
            that you create, submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the NodeConductor Services, including any
            intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content and the Application (whether those rights happen
            to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise
            in writing with OpenNode, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and
            that OpenNode has no obligation to do so on your behalf.</p>

        <p><strong>7.3</strong> Open source software licenses for components of the NodeConductor Services released
            under an open source license constitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent that the open
            source software licenses expressly supersede these Terms, the open source licenses govern your agreement
            with OpenNode for the use of the components of the NodeConductor Services released under an open source license.</p>

        <p><strong>18.4</strong> You agree that OpenNode may provide you with notices, including those regarding
            changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the NodeConductor web page. By providing
            OpenNode your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you any notices required
            by law in lieu of communication by postal mail.</p>
        <p><strong>18.5</strong> You agree that if OpenNode does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
            which is contained in the Terms (or which OpenNode has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will
            not be taken to be a formal waiver of OpenNode’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
            available to OpenNode.</p>
        <p><strong>18.6</strong> OpenNode shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations
            resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental
            action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures,
            and Internet disturbances.</p>
        <p><strong>18.7</strong> The Terms, and your relationship with OpenNode under the Terms, shall be governed
            by the laws of the Republic of Estonia without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and OpenNode
            agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the city of Tallinn, Estonia
            to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.</p>
        <p><strong>18.8</strong> Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under these Terms, whether
            by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be
            unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign the entirety of its rights
            and obligations under these Terms, without consent of the other party, to its affiliate or in connection
            with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets
            not involving a direct competitor of the other party. A party’s sole remedy for any purported assignment
            by the other party in breach of this paragraph shall be, at the non-assigning party’s election, termination
            of your use of the NodeConductor Services upon written notice to the assigning party.</p>
